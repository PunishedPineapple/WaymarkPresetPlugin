High Priority:

- Replace gimped mode popup with just help markers in the locations of missing buttons.


Low Priority:

- Add options to sort both zones and presets by name alphabetically (GitHub Issue #3).  We should probably do the next thing first:
- Make the library enumerable and protect the presets list.  This doesn't completely solve the potential for untracked changes (names and zone IDs can change), but it helps.  To be able to fully remove sorting the presets each frame, presets would have to have change events for those fields as well to which the library could subscribe.
- Give the UI a reference to the actual plugin object itself and see if we can get rid of duplicate functionality between the two parts.
- Look into getting information about multi-map situations from the lgbs in order to only show waymarks on the appropriate maps of a zone.  Starting point information to pick back up on this:
	- Basic paths to bg lgbs for zones are in Bg column of TerritoryType sheet.
	- Lumina command line to get basic bg lgb file information for say Pharos Sirius is therefore: Lumina.Cmd.exe file bg/ffxiv/sea_s1/dun/s1d4/level/bg.lgb extract --datapath "C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\sqpack"
	- No idea how to process the lgb for the map boundaries though.
		- These really looked like sets of floating point coordinates, but didn't seem to be any kind of reasonable bounding boxes.
- Try to constrain the aspect ratio of the map window if possible.


New Functionality:

- Look into placing a preset by placing each individual waymark to work around preset restrictions, but this honestly looks like a huge mess, and SE's code is doing timing stuff when placing a preset, so it might be even more weird.
	- See the WaymarkInfo.txt for some of how this appears to be handled by the game.
- Add buttons for clear waymarks and placing individual waymarks, as well as a button to open up the game's waymark interface.
- Once the above is done, look into intercepting the MainCommand for the waymarks button and bypassing the game's window entirely as an option (with an option to open it from the plugin's window).


Completed (Follow Up):

- Allow drag and drop (or context menu or something) swap of waymarks when editing?
	- https://github.com/goatcorp/suggestions/issues/206
- Option to tie plugin window to main game waymark window.
	- https://github.com/PunishedPineapple/WaymarkPresetPlugin/issues/17


Rejected:

- Maybe add "preferred for zone" or "starred" bool/checkmark in the info pane/editor as a field in a preset to tell if it should be given priority for auto load?
	- I feel like this would be getting into the area of more complexity than it's worth.
	- Added drag and drop reordering, which makes this even less useful.
- Think about whether ints or possbily even fixed-precision coordinates would be preferable to floats going forward.  Eliminates impact of rounding errors, but makes interop with other existing programs more difficult, and may or may not interfere with any future direct placement/saving features.  Are rounding errors even a potential issue as-is?
	-This has not been an issue, and is just added complexity.
